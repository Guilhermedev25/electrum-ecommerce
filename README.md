# 🛍️ Electrum E‑commerce Website

Hey there! 👋 I'm a junior front‑end developer, and I built **Electrum** — a fictional e‑commerce site made with HTML, SASS, and CSS. This project was a fun way for me to practice responsive design and clean code. 💻✨

## 📌 About

Electrum is a personal project to improve my front‑end development skills. It's focused on building a modern, responsive layout that looks good on all devices — desktop 🖥️, tablet 📱, and mobile 📲.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Fully responsive layout
- 🛒 Product listings with ratings & prices
- 🧾 Clean UI with smooth transitions
- 🕒 Countdown banner for special deals
- 📬 Newsletter signup form
- ❤️ Wishlist & shopping cart UI (static only)
- 📎 Footer with helpful navigation links

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🧱 HTML5 – semantic structure
- 🎨 SASS/SCSS – modular styles
- 🌈 CSS3 – Grid, Flexbox & animations
- ⭐ Font Awesome – icons
- 🔤 Google Fonts – “Open Sans”

## 🧪 Try It Out

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guilhermedev25/electrum-ecommerce.git
cd electrum-ecommerce
```

Open `index.html` or run a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then go to 👉 `http://localhost:8000`

## 📚 What I Learned

- Organizing styles with the 7-1 SASS pattern
- Creating responsive layouts using Grid & Flexbox
- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Structuring files for better maintainability 🗂️

## 🛠️ Future Goals

- 🧠 Add interactive JavaScript (cart logic, product filtering)
- 🔍 Product search functionality
- 🔐 Basic authentication flow
- 📷 Lazy loading images
- 🌙 Add a dark mode switch
- 🧪 Add basic unit tests
